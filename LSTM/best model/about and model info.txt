Validation and test is done with a validation data file that has no missing values. If there were any, they were filled in. It picks a random point in the day, gets the previous four points, and puts those into the model. Then it compares the rest of the day to the prediction and each point is differenced for the MSE.

Best model: 64 neurons, 3 layers, 128 batch, 0.001 rate, 5 seq len
